It seems like you're looking to automate the process of retrieving the database name from a Boolean-based SQL injection vulnerability. Below is a Python script that can assist you in achieving this:

```
python retrieve_db_name.py 192.168.0.1
```
Replace 192.168.0.1 with the actual IP address of the vulnerable web application. The script will then attempt to retrieve the database name character by character using Boolean-based SQL injection techniques and print the extracted database name once it's complete.

Make sure you have proper authorization before performing any security testing, and use this script responsibly and only on systems you are authorized to test.
